        <li>Please make sure you have carefully read through the description of the service you
        chose.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h5 class=" text-center pb-3"><u>Refills</u></h5>
    <ul class="mb-5">
        <li>Refill services receive a complimentary lash bath.</li>
        <li>Make sure you book the correct service. Example; If you book a 45 min touch up then
            that is all the time you are going to get.</li>
        <li>You must have 70% - 80% of lash extensions left for a one week (4-7 days) touch up
            refill.</li>
        <li>You must have no less than 40% - 50% of your lash extensions left for a two week (8-14
            days) refill.</li>
        <li>You must have no less than 40% - 50% of your lash extensions left for a three week
            (15-21 days) refill.</li>
        <li>If you notice poor retention 1-3 days after getting your lashes done. You will need to
            provide good quality pictures/videos no more than 3 days after for me to accept a
            complimentary OR $20 touch up. The touch up must be done 1-5 days after the initial
            appointment (with the same amount of lashes).
        </li>  <br>
        <p><strong>*Note*</strong> I personally need my lashes filled every 10-14 days due to having oily skin, fast lash
        shedding, humidity, etc. Everybody is different and your lashes MAY NOT last the full three
        weeks.</p>
    </ul>
 


    <h5 class=" text-center pb-3"><u>Rushing Appointments / Talking During Appointments</u></h5>
    <ul class="mb-5">
        <li>Refer back to the appointment duration time to know how long your appointment will
            take.</li>
        <li>Perfection takes time. Rushing me to finish a service is unacceptable. Rushing your
        appointments may result in no longer being able to book with tatilazobeauty.</li>
        <li>Please try to stay still during your appointments. Everyone signs consent forms prior to
            appointments agreeing that they are able to lay still for the whole procedure.</li>
        <li>It is 100% okay to talk during services as long as you can lay still (clients may be asked
            to temporarily stop talking if they move around tohave a lash nap, bring headphones to listen to your own
            music/podcast, ask me to play a movie so you can listen to it.</p>
    </ul>


    <h5 class=" text-center pb-3"><u>Weak/ Damaged / Poor Natural Lashes / Sensitive Eyes</u></h5>
    <ul class="mb-5">
        <li>Unfortunately, I will not work on clients (especially those who want long/dramatic
            lashes) if they have weak/damaged/poor natural lashes. We can always pick a shorter
            / more natural look OR give the clients lashes a break.</li> <br>
        <p>** Please book a 15 minute free consultation on my website if you are not sure if your natural
            lashes are in good condition.**</p> <br> <br>
        <p><strong>**NOTE** </strong> I speak from personal experience when I say it is OK to take lash extension breaks.
            (ideally 2 months using a lash serum) If you have had lashes for a long time please consider
            taking a break to grow out your natural lashes. Even if you see the best lash artist and follow
            your aftercare perfectly, it is still very possible that you will see damage to your natural lashes after
            having them for a long time. As your natural lashes grow, your extensions get farther and farther
            from the root of the lash. This makes it harder for your natural lashes to support the weight of
            the extension, which can cause breakage. Rubbing or itching your lashes in your sleep (either
            with your hands or against your pillow) can also cause damage to natural lashes.</p>
    </ul>

    <h5 class=" text-center pb-3"><u>DISCOUNTS (cannot be combined with other discounts)</u></h5>
    <ul class="mb-5">
        <li>$15 off an eyelash service on the month of your birthday with proof of ID. ♥ (does not
            apply to $20 touch up) </li>
        <li>$20 off any eyebrow lamination service if you book with a lash service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class=" text-center pb-3"><u>Other</u></h5>
    <ul class="mb-5">
        <li>Please avoid using your phone during your appointment. You may be asked to
            temporarily shut your phone off if it is interfering / distracting.</li>
        <li>If you do not drive please ask me to let you know 20 minutes before the appointment is
            done so that I can help you call your ride.</li>
        <li>If you wear eye contacts, please bring your eye contact case or wear glasses for your
            appointment (certain appointments require you to keep your eyes closed for a long
            period of time).</li>
    </ul>
 <br><br>
    <h3 class="text-center mb-5">Thank you so much! ♥♥♥</h3>
